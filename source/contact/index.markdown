My name is Damon Davison. You may have found me through my work in software
development. I'm active in the Ruby community and am currently an organizer for
[Rails Girls](http://railsgirls.com) in [London](http://railsgirls.co.uk)
and [South Florida](http://railsgirls-sfl.org).

I'm on all the social networks, but generally the best way to get in touch with
me is to send e-mail to [damon@allolex.net](mailto:damon@allolex.net).
