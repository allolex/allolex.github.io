I absolutely love this album! Here's a photo I took of Mothlite around the
time the album was released.

> Mothlite - from the debut album “Flax Of Reverie”. The album’s six pieces
encompass elements as diverse as choral madrigals cascading with strings, the
melody and dissonance of Arvo Part and Moondog and the cinematic, studio-as-
instrument manipulations of Pink Floyd, Coil, Cocteau Twins and late period
Talk Talk. Woodwind and percussion take their cue from the devotional mantras
of Alice Coltrane and Albert Ayler. O’Sullivan’s words are of the same
bloodline as Jorge Luis Borges, Lewis Carroll and Henry Williamson. Mothlite
will release their second album on K Scope in 2012.
