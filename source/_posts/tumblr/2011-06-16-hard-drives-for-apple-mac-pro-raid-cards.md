Having been stung quite recently when Apple Support ceased when they noticed I
was using Seagate Barracuda XT drives, I have done a little research into which
hard drives are used (and supported) by Apple.

For the record, Apple refuses to support any hardware that was not bought from
them on their RAID cards. See 
[Apple's site for more details](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1346#faq8).

The hard drives Apple has shipped to me are:

The Western Digital Caviar Black 1.0TB SATA, WD1001FALS-41Y6A0

This came shipped with a Mac Pro

The Hitachi DeskStar 72K2000 2.0TB, HDS722020ALA330

This we ordered this month from the Apple Store.
