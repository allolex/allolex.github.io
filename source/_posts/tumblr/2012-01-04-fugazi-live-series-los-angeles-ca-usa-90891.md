Dischord have started their release of the Fugazi Live Series.

> Between 1987 and 2003, Fugazi played over 1000 concerts in all 50 states and
all over the world. Over 800 of these shows were recorded by the band's sound
engineers. The goal of this project is to make each of these recordings
available to download for a small fee. We will start with 130 shows and
release more monthly until we're done. A searchable archive lists each show
along with available photos, flyers and general show info. Each listing with a
download offers a streaming preview of material for sound quality as well as
the reading and posting of comments on the show and the recording.

>

> The size and scope this archive dictates that it will remain a semi-
permanent work-in-progress. We welcome visitors to contribute photos,
recordings, corrections, and any additional info that may be missing from
specific shows. Please see the About section for information about
contributing content.

I was at the [September 8th show at the Hollywood Palladium in
1991](http://www.dischord.com/fugazi_live_series/los-angeles-ca-usa-90891),
but I don't have a contiguous memory of the gig. Hearing the audio from the
show when it is released is certain to bring back some memories.

I'm afraid neither of the opening bands left much of an impression, but then
again we were there for Fugazi. It was a big deal.
