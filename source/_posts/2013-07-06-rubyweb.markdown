[**Rubyweb**](https://github.com/allolex/rubyweb) is a small program I wrote to
address a small problem, but one that keeps popping up. Apparently, the
"normal" way of running a simple web server in Ruby is too difficult, so people
have been using Python's *SimpleHTTPServer* instead. Now I'm totally cool with
using Python or any other language's tools to do that, but the main argument
seems to be the number of characters you have to type in order to launch the
web server.

**Rubyweb** is very simple to install and use:

```
gem install rubyweb
rubyweb
```

Have a look at [**Rubyweb**'s GitHub repo](https://github.com/allolex/rubyweb) and
let me know what you think.
