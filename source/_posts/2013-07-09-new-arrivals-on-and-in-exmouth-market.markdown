In the last several months, there have been several new arrivals on Exmouth Market.

The Japanese restaurant Bincho closed, and in its place is the **Potato Merchant**,
which does American steakhouse-style "twice baked" potatoes where the potato is
baked, then the starchy insides are mixed with (generally fatty) fillings, put
back inside the skin and crisped up in the oven. I always avoid loads of starch
at lunchtime, so I haven't bothered with them.

The premises that had stood empty for months after the Starbucks shut down is
now a **Hummus Brothers**. Ironically, I don't particularly like the hummus
there, but the falafel wraps are very good and about as healthy as a deep-fried
food can be.

In the market itself, there is a new stand all the way on the Mount Pleasant
end that sells Brazilian *brigadeiros*. It's called the **London Brigadeira**.
*Brigadeiros* are sweet truffles made of condensed milk and various
flavourings. They are very nice, and quite addictive. You should definitely
stop by and say hello to Emmaâ€”there are free samples, after all.
