server</a></p>

<p>In my role of Production Manager at Southern, I keep running across rather,
shall we say &ldquo;sub-optimal&rdquo; server configurations for delivering masters,
artwork and other very large files to manufacturers.</p>

<p>For example, one of the plants we have worked with has a single SFTP account
for all their clients to upload their masters to. It&rsquo;s not an append-only
solution like an OS X &ldquo;Drop Box&rdquo; where people can&rsquo;t see what was uploaded&mdash;you
can potentially download other companies' masters. Another company we work
with for digital retail doesn&rsquo;t let you read anything, but you can see all of
their clients. There aren&rsquo;t many servers I think have been set up well.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve decided that it&rsquo;s a basic system administration skill to be able to set
up private, chrooted SFTP accounts for any number of users on a system, so I&rsquo;m
linking to this HOWTO, which worked very well for me. Just create a user and
home directory, add it to the &ldquo;transfer&rdquo; group, create a subdirectory under
the home and chmod it so it&rsquo;s world readable/writable/whatever.</p>

<p>A couple of important notes about the configuration:</p>

<ul>
<li>Make sure you put the &ldquo;Match&rdquo; stanza at the very end of the ssd_config file. I had a single directive after it, which sshd parsed as if it were part of the stanza. Not good.</li>
<li>Even though the entire path has to belong to and be writable only by root, you can still use the %h variable to chroot individual user directories, and then put useful directories underneath the home, for instance &ldquo;pick_up&rdquo; and &ldquo;drop_off&rdquo; or similar.</li>
</ul>


<p>Here&rsquo;s the bottom (and relevant) part of my sshd_config:</p>

<p>{% highlight python %}</p>

<h1>Subsystem sftp /usr/lib/openssh/sftp-server</h1>

<p>Subsystem sftp internal-sftp<br/>
UsePAM yes  # not relevant to this discussion, but see my point</p>

<pre><code>        # above about Match being at the *bottom*
</code></pre>

<p>Match Group transfer  <br/>
  ChrootDirectory %h  <br/>
  AllowTCPForwarding no   <br/>
  X11Forwarding no<br/>
  ForceCommand internal-sftp
{% endhighlight %}</p>
