    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to typography, I&rsquo;m by no means an expert, but I <em>do</em> know what I
like. All design elements being equal, I think typography is more equal.
Typography can make or break a design, so I chose to start with typography and
not make very many changes at all to the default Octopress template Allexicon
uses.</p>

<p>Convenience is important to me. I&rsquo;m very busy and I don&rsquo;t have a lot of time to
spend working on getting things right. I&rsquo;d rather spend the time writing, or on
one of my other projects that has nothing to do with my blog.  Convenience is
the reason I went with a cloud-based solution.</p>

<p>I also want my blog to look distinctive. Less often used fonts have the
advantage in this respect; I don&rsquo;t want to use the same fonts as everyone else.
This is the primary reason I completely discounted Google Fonts and gave Adobe
Typekit a miss.</p>

<p>Although I really like the &ldquo;small is beautiful&rdquo; nature of Hoefler &amp;
Frere-Jones&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.typography.com/cloud/welcome/">cloud.typography</a>
platform and convenience and distinctiveness are important to me, the beautiful
fonts (and great font features, e.g. swashes) really sold me on it.</p>
