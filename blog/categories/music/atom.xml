    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s about motivation, about outsider music, about people who are driven to
make music because they have to make it, and not because they want to be on
the cover of a magazine or because they&rsquo;re commercially motivated. It&rsquo;s just a
common mindset, really. It&rsquo;s more important that we have the same way of
thinking than what kind of music people are making (although that&rsquo;s obviously
very important as well). If I meet someone that&rsquo;s making really great music &ndash;
be it a band or label &ndash; that I really love, and I sit down and talk with them
and don&rsquo;t connect on a kind of business ethic sense, then I don&rsquo;t want to work
with them. It&rsquo;s about the whole package.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I absolutely love this album! Here&rsquo;s a photo I took of Mothlite around the
time the album was released.</p>

<p><a href="http://southernrec.tumblr.com/post/17704014421/mothlite-from-%0Athe-debut-album-flax-of-reverie">southernrec</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Mothlite &ndash; from the debut album “Flax Of Reverie”. The album’s six pieces
encompass elements as diverse as choral madrigals cascading with strings, the
melody and dissonance of Arvo Part and Moondog and the cinematic, studio-as-
instrument manipulations of Pink Floyd, Coil, Cocteau Twins and late period
Talk Talk. Woodwind and percussion take their cue from the devotional mantras
of Alice Coltrane and Albert Ayler. O’Sullivan’s words are of the same
bloodline as Jorge Luis Borges, Lewis Carroll and Henry Williamson. Mothlite
will release their second album on K Scope in 2012.</p></blockquote>
