    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s been really sunny and warm in London for a few days now. At work, we spend
as much time as possible outdoors, which isn&rsquo;t very much time at all—the life
of a software developer may have its perks, but being close to nature isn&rsquo;t
one of them. But the &ldquo;downstairs&rdquo; conference room is getting good use, and
nearby Spa Fields has become our lunch room—ours and everyone else&rsquo;s within a
half-mile.</p>

<p>We had a sunny spell about a month ago, at the beginning of June, and Spa
Fields were lush with green grass. Now the dryness of summer has baked the
foliage until crisp and brown, but after eight months of cold, rainy grey we
are grateful for the sunshine, regardless.</p>
