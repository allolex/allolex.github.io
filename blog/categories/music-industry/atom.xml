    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s about motivation, about outsider music, about people who are driven to
make music because they have to make it, and not because they want to be on
the cover of a magazine or because they&rsquo;re commercially motivated. It&rsquo;s just a
common mindset, really. It&rsquo;s more important that we have the same way of
thinking than what kind of music people are making (although that&rsquo;s obviously
very important as well). If I meet someone that&rsquo;s making really great music &ndash;
be it a band or label &ndash; that I really love, and I sit down and talk with them
and don&rsquo;t connect on a kind of business ethic sense, then I don&rsquo;t want to work
with them. It&rsquo;s about the whole package.</p>
