  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&rsquo;s been really sunny and warm in London for a few days now. At work, we spend
as much time as possible outdoors, which isn&rsquo;t very much time at all—the life
of a software developer may have it&rsquo;s perks, but being close to nature isn&rsquo;t
one of them. But the &ldquo;downstairs&rdquo; conference room is getting good use, and
nearby Spa Fields has become our lunch room—ours and everyone else&rsquo;s within a
half-mile.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7432/9249280543_1a8711d675_h.jpg" alt="The Bambinos in Spa Fields" /></p>

<p>We had a sunny spell about a month ago, at the beginning of June, and Spa
Fields were lush with green grass. Now the dryness of summer has baked the
foliage until crisp and brown, but after eight months of cold, rainy grey we
are grateful for the sunshine, regardless.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been so busy working on the nuts and bolts of organization that I&rsquo;ve
hardly spared a breath to write about what I&rsquo;ve been up to. Exactly <em>what</em> I&rsquo;m
organizing is <a href="http://railsgirls-sfl.org">Rails Girls South Florida</a>, which
will take place in the Miami area in November. It will be awesome!</p>

<p><a href="http://railsgirls-sfl.org"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5506/9232564805_470bb53bbe_o.png" alt="Rails Girls SFL website" /></a></p>

<h2>Rails Girls</h2>

<p><a href="http://railsgirls.com">Rails Girls</a>, in case you don&rsquo;t already know, is a
workshop designed to teach women how to program. The goal is to provide women
with the chance to get excited about technology, especially software
development, and give them the tools they need to build their own ideas.</p>

<p>My own motivation for organizing Rails Girls is to fight the tendency the
software development community has towards building a tall, narrow monoculture and
increase the breadth and diversity of the community by bringing in people from
the outside who are different in important ways.  The community, and therefore
the profession, of software development becomes stronger when many different
people of many different backgrounds take part in it. Gender diversity is
one of the easiest, and most obvious areas in which we can improve our profession
as a whole.</p>

<h2>Workshop at RubyConf 2013 in Miami Beach</h2>

<p>I had the idea to do a Rails Girls workshop just as soon as I saw that
<a href="http://rubyconf.org">RubyConf</a> is taking place in Miami Beach this year. I&rsquo;ve
been an organizer for Rails Girls London since the beginning (a story for
another post), so I&rsquo;m pretty sure I know how to make one happen—it&rsquo;s really not
that complicated, but it does require a fair amount of work and some good
organization. I guess that&rsquo;s why they call it &ldquo;organizing&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I then got on the Rails Girls worldwide team mailing list to see if anyone else
was organizing anything in South Florida, and I checked the website to see if
there had been anything at all in the area. The only thing I found was a
request for a workshop in Fort Lauderdale by &ldquo;Cristina&rdquo;, who sadly forgot to
include her contact information when she made the request. However, I also saw
that newly-minted Ruby Hero <a href="http://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=hone02">Terence Lee</a>
was going to be in South Florida and was interested in helping with the
workshop. I also wrote to Terence to see if he was still interested in helping
organize a workshop—he was.</p>

<p>I then got in touch with Ruby Central, who organize RubyConf, and asked for
their blessing. Abigail Phoenix was tremendously helpful and put me in contact
with the confereence venue to see if we could find some space for the workshop.
She also offered to help promote the workshop via RubyConf&rsquo;s social media.</p>

<p>Our Rails Girls workshop is timed to happen just ahead of RubyConf 2013 so
that we can take advantage of the pool of potential coaches that will flock to
South Florida for the conference. I suspect attendence will be excellent, even
for RubyConf&rsquo;s high standards, thanks in part to the attraction of South
Florida&rsquo;s tropical climate.</p>

<p>Last weekend, I got the web site up and running, but it wasn&rsquo;t pretty, so this
weekend I installed atheme and modified it, making sure the typography is
tolerable. There&rsquo;s still some work to go, but by and large, the site looks
really good.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m using nice fonts from <a href="http://typography.com">typography.com</a>, which my New
Bamboo colleague <a href="http://twitter.com/danbee">Dan Barber</a> turned me on to just
last week. We&rsquo;re both typography lovers.</p>

<p>When the time comes, we&rsquo;ll also get the
<a href="http://github.com/railsgirlslondon/railsgirlslondon">Rails Girls application</a>
up and running. It was written by the organization team of Rails Girls London,
primarily <a href="http://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=despo">Despo Pentara</a>,
and is a very useful tool for putting together events and taking applications.
You can see it in action on the <a href="http://railsgirls.co.uk">Rails Girls London site</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="https://github.com/allolex/rubyweb"><strong>Rubyweb</strong></a> is a small program I wrote to
address a small problem, but one that keeps popping up. Apparently, the
&ldquo;normal&rdquo; way of running a simple web server in Ruby is too difficult, so people
have been using Python&rsquo;s <em>SimpleHTTPServer</em> instead. Now I&rsquo;m totally cool with
using Python or any other language&rsquo;s tools to do that, but the main argument
seems to be the number of characters you have to type in order to launch the
web server.</p>

<p><strong>Rubyweb</strong> is very simple to install and use:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>gem install rubyweb
</span><span class='line'>rubyweb</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Have a look at <a href="https://github.com/allolex/rubyweb"><strong>Rubyweb</strong>&rsquo;s GitHub repo</a> and
let me know what you think.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I got home yesterday, I noticed that our 2009 Mac Pro was unresponsive. I
checked to see if it was on the network, and then powered it down. When I
turned it back on, it booted into the recovery volume.</p>

<p>That Mac Pro had a RAID 5 array on it, composed of four 2TB hard drives,
bought for a premium price from Apple so they would support the system.</p>

<p>I opened up the RAID utility and saw that the RAID controller was recognising
all four hard drives were no longer in a RAID set. Although all of them were
reporting that they were &ldquo;ok&rdquo;, the RAID set and therefore the RAID volume were
gone.</p>

<p>I telephoned Apple, happy to pay for someone to guide me through the recovery
since there is <strong>absolutely no</strong> documentation on recovering a RAID 5 system
with a missing RAID set. Their technical support was courteous, but not well-
informed.</p>

<p>After going over it and leaving it with them to &ldquo;investigate&rdquo; further, I
received a phone call today from the person who was helping me. The short of
it is that Apple say if your RAID set is missing, you&rsquo;re screwed. They also
say that you should not be using RAID for backup purposes, as it&rsquo;s only
designed to protect you from disk failure.</p>

<p>But of course it wasn&rsquo;t a disk that failed. It was the RAID itself, and it
took out all our data with it. We will be restoring from backup, but the size
of the RAID (4.7TB) meant that backing up to external drives is complicated,
and our backups are not completely up-to-date.</p>

<p>The point is that we paid nearly £500 for the RAID card and it has proved to
be a complete waste of money. If your Dell RAID dies on you, then Dell will
help you recover it, but clearly Apple don&rsquo;t take their business support
seriously.</p>
